site here: https://lukedevse.github.io/subteraudiolibrary/
if you want to contribute anything, make a pull request.
as currently, it only has a small amount of users and the site looks ugly.
and please do not throw my code into chatgpt and say "make site look better" and make a pull request
# want to add more users?
https://www.subter.org/v2/users/ID/inventory/3?limit=100
replace ID with the user id and go to that page, then right click, save as, and set it to the ID.json
then add the name of the json into the users array, and put the json in the users folder.
## i dont want to get near any code
then just suggest the users in the issues page
